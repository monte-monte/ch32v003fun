# Example CAN Bus Network

# Hardware
This example uses PA11 and PA12 as CAN RX and TX pin.
Normally, you would use a PHY to connect the CAN controller to the bus, but you can make a simple PHY for testing purposes with a few diodes and resistors.

> [!WARNING]
> DO NOT connect this simple PHY to an actual CAN bus! This is only for testing if you don't have a PCB with a proper PHY yet.

```
You can add as many nodes as you want.
This circuit is not differential.

# Usage
Flash the code with `TRANSMIT 1` on one device and `TRANSMIT 0` on the other device.

If you add more nodes, change the `ID` so that you know which node is which.
You can mix extended and standard IDs.

All nodes must have the same `BAUD`.

# I2C to USB adapter

This is a ch32 port/reimplementation of [I2C-Tiny-USB](https://github.com/harbaum/I2C-Tiny-USB/) for Atmel chips (atmega328, attiny85). That one has a linux kernel driver that is present on most of modern linux distros, so it should work out of the box. Original firmware was using bit-banged USB driver, so it was only LS capable, since this is using hardware USB FS, EP buffer is larger - 64 bytes.

This implementation will work on any WCH's RiscV chip with hardware USB (ch32x03x, ch32v103, ch32l103, ch32v20x, ch32v30x, ch32h41x, ch5xx). It uses USB FS peripheral.

Since linux driver is hardcoded for specific VID:PID pair, this firmware uses that too. If you change it, it will stop working with ``i2c-tiny-usb`` device driver.

You can change other strings in ``usb_config.h``, though.

## How to use

- Select your MCU model in the ``Makefile``
- Change I2C SDA and CLK pins if you want
- Check other options.
- Connect your board and do ``make`` in this folder.
- Connect via USB to a PC and use software that can use default i2c driver, for example ``i2cdetect``. You may need to run commands as sudo. If you want to be able to use your i2c device as user, you can install udev rules with ``make install_udev_rules`` or copy it manually.

## Notable mention

I was testing this firmware on this https://github.com/armlabs/ssd1306_linux

Almost everyone has one of those OLEDs in their stash and it nice to see it works from the linux command line :)
